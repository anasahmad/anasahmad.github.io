  <section><h2 id="object-oriented-programming-with-go">Object-Oriented Programming with Go</h2>
<p>Go is a language that was designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, and as such, it does not have built-in support for traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. However, Go does have some features that can be used to achieve similar functionality in a more flexible and lightweight way.</p>
<p>The primary feature in Go that supports OOP-style programming is struct embedding. Struct embedding allows a struct to include another struct as a field, effectively inheriting its fields and methods. This can be used to create a type hierarchy similar to that used in traditional OOP languages.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>type Animal struct {
    Name string
}

func (a *Animal) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%s says hi!\n&#34;, a.Name)
}

type Dog struct {
    Animal
}

func main() {
    d := Dog{Animal{Name: &#34;Fido&#34;}}
    d.Speak()
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, the Animal struct defines a single field Name and a method Speak(). The Dog struct embeds Animal, effectively inheriting its Name field and Speak() method. We can create a new Dog instance and call its Speak() method, which is implemented by the Animal struct.</p>
<p>Another feature that supports OOP-style programming in Go is interfaces. Interfaces allow a type to declare a set of method signatures that other types can implement. This can be used to achieve polymorphism, as a variable of an interface type can hold any value that implements that interface.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

type Animal struct {
    Name string
}

func (a *Animal) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%s says hi!\n&#34;, a.Name)
}

type Dog struct {
    Animal
}

func (d *Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%s barks!\n&#34;, d.Name)
}

func main() {
    animals := []Speaker{
        &amp;Animal{Name: &#34;Fido&#34;},
        &amp;Dog{Animal{Name: &#34;Rex&#34;}},
    }

    for _, a := range animals {
        a.Speak()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, we define an interface called Speaker that declares a single method Speak(). The Animal and Dog structs both implement this method, allowing them to be used interchangeably as values of type Speaker. We create a slice of Speaker instances and call the Speak() method on each one in a loop, demonstrating polymorphism.</p>
